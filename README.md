## Project Description
This project is mainly targetting the UN's Life Below Water SDG and we are hoping to develop a Android mobile application with the aim of reducing the ocean pollution and increasing awareness about marine conservation among people. We are creating this under four parts,

● Admin and User Management    
●	News Feed and Article Management   
●	Beaches and Resources Management   
●	Endangered Species Management   

Mainly this application will be used by people who are related to the marine field as well as anyone who is interested in marine conservation. Each of the above functions will be associated with basic CRUD operations
